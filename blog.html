	<h1>In class activity one</h1>
	<P>The first video we saw in class is about a gay’s experience. And the video is started with silent slide. And then the author said, “I am a gay”. And he cried. It was a very emotional video, which makes all audience feel touched. I think it helps me to create the narrative essay because it teaches the way to spread emotion and touch audience.

</P>
<h1>In class activity 2</h1>
<P>We watched a movie named The Social Network. It is a movie talking about the establish of the Facebook. The main character is a really free person that he quit the university to do his career. The movie is just a showing about one successful example in society. However, I think the regular education is important to most of people. People whom success without degree are countable in the society. The major of famous and successful people are well educated. Therefore, it is not genius to copy his sample to quit school. It is better to follow the way fits oneself</P

<p>Next week will be the thanks giving holiday. The semester has started for a long time and finally the break is coming, although I don't have a plan for the thanks giving yet. I hope to stay at home maybe video with my friends or may go shopping at Troy for the black friday. Hopefully, there will be no snow and temperture does not go down as well.</p>
<p>For last week the thanks giving weekend, I went to Miami without plan. It was a quick decision made on 3 am Wensday morning and we went to catch the flight at 10. The weather in Miami is really good because i am from seaside city. The weather is wet and warm and I can wear shorts and t-shirts to go out. I can smell the sea and eat lots of seafood like different kinds of shells. And we do lots of shopping because of the black friday sales. </p>
