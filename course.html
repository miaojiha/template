        <p>WRA 110 is one of the required course for students to do in university. And it is also a course help student understand and improve in college academic writing. And WRA 110 is also a course related to technology. I learnt how to create and format website in this class.
	</p><p>For the first essay, Lived Experience, it is a narrative detailing how a specific technology has impacted your choice of a major/career at the present time. In this paper, I wrote my experience in high school. It was the first time I made a movie. And I began my interests in media since that time. For doing this essay, I watched again the movie I took in high school. And I feel different from the time I took it. I think the first essay is a easy one to do. It was just a narrative and I only need to talk the story about myself. However, the most difficult part is about the length. It leads me need to make the essay as detail as possible.
	</p><p>The second essay, cultural artifact asks us to write essay about artifact in popular culture and its social issue. When I first think about popular culture artifact related to technology, I think about electric product. And iPhone became my final choice to do. For this paper, it more focused on the social issue the artifact creates instead of describing about itself. Also, it is not only explaining about issue, but also needs solution for it. It requires complex thinking. And I wrote communication, information security and life security in this project.
	</p><p>Third essay, formal researching, is trying to tell people about my major. I think it is a development from first essay. It moved my view about my major to general thought about it in the society. And one purpose for this research is leading audience interesting in this area because in general’s eye academic researching is boring. I choose to do about film because my major is media and information and film is part of it. I thought about how to attract audience while I wrote it. The history is the first idea appeared in my mind because history likes stories. And film history is related to famous movies and directors and it can be a recall from people’s mind. And this researching requiring a interview. It troubles me at first. Unlike from other area, the movie industry people are more celebrity and busy person. Finally, I find a producer that I knew from last winter in China. He was in work for a movie at that time. I asked about how each parts of a movie team work to put in my research. 
	</p><p>Remix project is one we are doing right now with a group. We choose to do an artifact tea from our group member’s work. It is one I most like to do during this semester. Making a documentary is kind of in my area. And we are doing create script, making scene and doing narrative for this movie. I think the most difficult part for this movie is to control the length and extrude main point. Although we have lots of ideas for the movie right now, we are going to choose several parts and cut some interesting  to do the documentary.</p>
