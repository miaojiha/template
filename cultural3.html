Cases are not only a protection, but also a fashion and representation personality. Type, camera, or animal shape cases are beautiful and characteristic to see. For example, some girls using shining crystals stick on their phone to make iPhone look cute. Business people use leather cases to present serious.  I uses a case looks like a book. The reason is it looks cool and it has card cases inside. Therefore, I do not need to carry lots of things in my hand. Also, the case is very protectable for my phone.

And it can use as a camera, a music player, a recorder, an e-book and a map.  One of the convenience function iPhone contains is APP. It let other station could work on a small phone, like camera, game player, record, editor, computer and dictionary. For example, a dictionary app I used often is called YOUDAO. It is easy to use to translate between English, Chinese and Japanese.  It also contains a useful and fun translation function called camera dictionary. It can catch the word by camera. It is very useful while shopping in the supermarket. It helps to determine and differentiate similar elements.</p>
