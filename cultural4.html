			<h1>Description of Issue</h1>
			<p>However, the iPhone brings some troubles to our society at the same time while it leads fashion and provides help. The iPhone people often use social media APP in their phone, like Facebook, twitter, wechat, instagram or other similar webpage. It is an interesting to share photos or experience with friends. However, people today are mostly over depending on those. Their communication way is changed. The visual and oral communication becomes behind the virtual ways in young people. Even when they sit together on the dining table, they may just play with their own phones. I don’t think it should be the right way to stay with people’s relation. Although people still look like close relation, without wording or face-to-face communication, it more looks like a showing off way.</p>
			<p>Another danger is also coming from those big fans. They are playing on phones everywhere they go. They are playing even while they walk across the street with their earphone listening to music. It is dangerous to do. And it causes many troubles and traffic problem. I watched a funny video before. A woman was playing on her phone and walking. She did not notice what in front of her. And then, she was tripped and fell into the swimming pool. I laughed while I watched it. However, it would be serious situation while it happened around us in the real life. Also some people play their phones even border others surrounding and they are not even recognized about it. </p>
			<p>The security of information makes people feel worry about smart phones. One of the reasons is coming from locating function in the phone. It can locate wherever you are and send to the center. Although it helped when you lost the iPhone, it also makes possible to steal those information. (Epstein) At the same time, when people open a new app, it asks do you want to share information. The app providers keep those information together. However, how can you tell the storing is safe or they are not selling information? Contact or other info in the iPhone is very value and privacy to each user. Also, many people today using phone to do payment. Security’s perfectibility is a major challenging to Apple Company. </p>
