                <h1>Research about film industry</h1>
            <p>Media and information is a major studying TV, radio, film, social media, media management and other technical related media cases program. Studying about film is a big part of our study. This research is doing to help people know ideas about the world of film.
</p><p>Film was a technology appeared in late 19 century. During the short history, film develops a lot, from state to dynamic, silence to phonic, black to colorful. Movie plays a role more than just entertainment in people’s daily life now. And it is an enormous industry related to many areas such as advertising, writing, marketing, producing and others.
	</p><p>Movie started with silence when it first appeared. Although the movie producer got ideas to make movie phonic, it stayed with silence about 40 years due to technic problem. Silence movie uses aggressive body language and facial expression to let audience understand about ideas.  A famous actor for silence movie we know is Chaplin. Chaplin had established a consistent character that he played in his movie for about 20 years: the Little Tramp. The Little Tramp was always poor, and thus Chaplin’s films always had an element of poverty. (Halperin) Silent films were commonly accompanied by live musicians and sometimes sound effect and even commentary spoken by the showman or projectionist. 
	 </p><p>Later on, movie began to combine with sound due to technology developed. In 1927, Warner Bros, a Hollywood studio released a movie with most part silent but have a few synchronized dialogue (and singing) in the movie The Jazz Singer. (Wiki)
	</p><p>Move to eye to the other side of world, in Asia, the movie industry went to a Golden Age in 1950s. One of the most important Japanese director in this time is Kenji Mizoguchi. He produced famous movies such as Osaka Elegy, The Story of the Last Chrysanthemums, Sansho the Bailiff and Ugetsu. The international success of his 1952 masterpiece The Life of Oharu, which won the Silver Lion at the Venice film festival, did much to popularise Japanese cinema in the west. (Volta) 
	</p><p>Those above were significant history for western and eastern movie development. And later on movie industry went to a flat developing mood, movies have more dialog, music and become colorful. Cinema is not the only way to see a movie, tape and VCD appeared in last century. 
	</p><p>1990s, it was a time important for American movie. Commercial movies got successful in this time. Lots of them we are still remember now, like Titanic, Jurassic Park, and Terminators2. Titanic was also the first movie I saw in cinema. Those movies are all examples for high-budget product, which related to marketing of film would be talked about later in this research. Another significant point for this time is the computer animation become popular. Due to the successful for Disney’s cartoon-Beauty and Beast and Toy Story, Film studios feel that family audience was a big market. Companies like 20th century FOX; Dreamworks and Disney were competing in this market.
	</p><p>DVD is a new invention in 21st century. It brought higher quality and larger memory comparing to VCD to bring cinema to each individual home. And in 21 century, movie goes more variable. 3D, IMAX and 4D make the sense of movie stuck. Cinema has more effect and feeling than home watching.
	</p><p>Above is a short history of movie. In the beginning of the commercial movie century, Hollywood produces lots of high budget, scientific and action movie to get audience. All of them have high visual shock, but with similar plot and setting. At this time, a few low budget movies published. And they got high box and evaluation surprise. One of successful low budget movie is Paranormal Activity I direct by Oren Peli. The budget of the movie was only $15000 and the box office worldwide created $193million. (English) It is an independent studio work. The director was also working as writer, cameraman and editor. It is also a reason for its low budget. The novelty story makes the movie got “Fresh” review from audience and critic. (Tomatoes) By this way, we can easily see that people are wanting fresh and new thinking movie in the market. They prefer to develop an unfamiliar world by movie instead of watching something they know what would happen. 
	</p><p>For a successful movie, it is not only get positive reviews in professional area and audience; winning a movie prize such as Oscar. It also produces big profits in box offices and some related area. One example for movie related sale is movie product. Drinks, food and other small items in life are shaped to movie characters and posters, especially in Asia. And DVD box is a huge and beneficial product for fans. With the first, second or limited edition named. Fans go crazy with idols’ sign or special present. An example is from the movie Despicable Me. The character minions in the movie go popular when the movie shows in cinema. The movie producer also cooperated with McDonald to send minions as gifts with meal. People who get this gift may did not watch the movie but they would be interesting to watch. And people who feel fun about the movie would like go to McDonald for a minion. It is a win-win marketing decision. </p>
	<p><img src="me.jpg" width="300" height="300" alt="myself" longdesc="me.jpg" /></p>
	<p>A mean character attract audience to see a movie is the prevue. We watch the prevue advertise online, on TV, in the beginning of a movie. Especially, prevue happens in video website, at beginning of the video, it is a force for people to watch the prevue. Prevue is combining all the most exciting and interesting parts of a movie. And it always leaves the question and mystery at the end. And it motivates audience to go to cinema watch the movie next time. Audience cannot wait to discover the mystery, although they feel different while they watch the real movie sometimes.
	</p><p>As I interviewed with a Chinese film company’s producer Zhang about how movie sales, He tells me that producers are not only working to sell a movie. They are working at start of the movie. When the director got a topic want to make a movie, he would review about the script and plan with thinking about budget and benefit. And if it were possible to producer, producer would find companies and individuals to investment. They need find commercial sponsorship as well. Finding actors and staff also maybe their work. With all those prepared, the movie can be started. During the process, producer also the one to check and confirm schedules with the whole group and check quality of the work. Their work likes catalyzer in chemistry: rush group finishing work fast with quality as well. Producers did lots of work not only in art area, but also in managing, business, communication and other areas. 
	</p><p>Producer is a job need communication to lots of people. For example, they should explain clearly about the future profit to investor. Investor may not be people knowing lots about art or movie. While asking money from these kind of people, producer should showing data and words information. Not only talking about the art effect or value would be. 
	</p><p>Producer plays an important role film industry especially film marketing. Hollywood pays $4 billion advertising on print and TV each year. And each movie only plays in cinema about a month. (Westland) It was the major way studios for commercial in the past. Now, the advertising allocates more on Website, especially social network. Comparing with traditional media, web commercial is cheaper and fast readable. People watching TV and reading newspaper are not really interesting in cinema by discovering. And the audience on Internet more likely the target group who would go to cinema. With in social network, it easy to do comment and share information. And it is simple to let people join in a event. And social network is not only popular in normal people, most of celebrities use as well. A characteristic for people online is like to follow. Production company pays celebrity not much amount to post something like, “xx is interesting.” Their fans would like to go to watch it. It is a fast and effective commercial comparing with newspaper or TV. And it is a forced commercial as mentioned above.
	</p><p>With introducing about the job of producer, how about other workers in a movie do? As people all know about that director is the spirit of a movie. He was the person organizing in the creating group. Director is the one majorly think how to put script to a shoot, how actors express the motion and other issue related to act. Tools, Lighting，Costume, make up and styling are all parts of back up team. It is the group providing the supply and need to a movie. Their work looks like not important as director or producer. But food or drink supply, actors make up and style are key to run a film team. In some historical movie, advisor would also be a key person. They are not people in film area. Majority of them are from academic area. While the movie took place in history period, the advisor is the person to correct information in script, clothing, way that characters talk and tools. They are working to get the movie work more correctly. Actors and special effect actors are audiences see on screen. They follow the script and director’s instruction and add their own mood and skill to produce a character. Special effect actors are a group of people with training skills who can do dangerous action instead of actors. They are always faceless and nameless in a movie, although they are doing work hard and dangerous. Editors are group to edit and add special effect to clips from cameramen. Usually they got thousands of hour clips and they are doing it into two hours film. Editing is a work need patient and creative. They can minimize a mistake and aggressive bright point by computer technology and their mind. For some low budget movie, a person always working in many position to save money. As the Paranormal Activity mentioned above, the director is an example. 
	</p><p>For staffs in a movie, the most efficient way to recognize their work is the prize. And Oscar is one of them, and the most important one in the world. The small golden man also named as Academy Award with age of 85 years old. It encourages excellence movie producing and developing. It awards towards worldwide films. And actors, directors, musicians and others win the award would be famous worldly. 
	</p><p>For audience, film is not the only entertainment they can choose. They have variable of choices like, sports, TV, video games, and travel. Comparing with other, film is a easy, short, and sharable entertainment. It is an enjoyable activity for family goes to cinema together. It is short comparing with watching TV whole day. It does not need much thought and control comparing with video games. It is much cheaper than travel. Film develops because it brings happiness to people. While asks general why they are going to watch a movie. Some answers for their favorite stars. Some answers for directors’ fans. Some answers for the attractive prevue. Some answers for the plot. Audiences all have their reasons to love a movie. There is why film develops. And in the future, how the film will go to be? Maybe 5D or 6D occurs. Maybe audience can involve in a movie. Those all may happen due to technology development.
