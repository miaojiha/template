		<h1>lived experiences project title</h1>
		<p>I have plenty of dreaming work when I was in childhood, like detective, police officer, lawyer, director, play writer and so on. Studying in media was what I decided in high school. It is a study to do create, edit or direct static and dynamic image.</p>
		<p>It is an assignment from art class, taking a movie.  I formed a group with four friends. The story of our story is about bullying in the school.  It was about two power people is the school and two girls being bullied. And at the end, they cannot stand any more and do a revenge for the bad.</p>
