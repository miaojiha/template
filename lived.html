		<h1>lived experiences project title</h1>
		<p>I have plenty of dreaming work when I was in childhood, like detective, police officer, lawyer, director, play writer and so on. Studying in media was what I decided in high school. It is a study to do create, edit or direct static and dynamic image.</p>
		<p>It is an assignment from art class, taking a movie.  I formed a group with four friends. The story of our story is about bullying in the school.  It was about two power people is the school and two girls being bullied. And at the end, they cannot stand any more and do a revenge for the bad.</p>
	<p>The scene for the movie is simple. And we only use about one week to take the video clips. For everyday after class or the break time to do it. Also we went to seaside to take some scene because my school was in a resort area. It was only about one mile to go to the sea.</p>
		<p>Although the technic of filming was simple at that time, I started to be interested to film. Planning a stage and making people beautiful on screen is not easy to do. And I learnt using bright or dark light to create atmosphere. One of member in our team is a experienced cameraman. She was the major filming person, and I did help her and learn many things from her.</p>
