		<h1>Filmmaking leads me to media world</h1>
		<p>I have plenty of dreaming work when I was in childhood, like detective, police officer, lawyer, director, play writer and so on. Studying in media was what I decided in high school. It is a study to do create, edit or direct static and dynamic image. This is what I hope to do as a future job, working with film or TV Company. The reason is my experience with a filmmaking creates my interests in this field. My understanding about a future job is more related to interests rather than salary. </p>
		<p>It was an assignment from art class when I was in grade 10. Teacher asked us to form a small group and make a movie. For the movie, there is nothing specific require. It made the movie hard to do because the topic and area is too broad. I formed my group with four friends. And we started to talk what we want to do. The first idea I got is about a murder case because I am interesting in mystery story. However, the tool and scene are hard to produce and we probably need copy from a famous story, it not much creative. Finally, we got a story about bullying in the school. It was not about real story in our life, but it might be real happening some other place we thought. It was about two power people is the school and two girls being bullied. And at the end, they cannot stand any more and do a revenge for the bad. To contribute the movie, we used four peopleâ€™s view, their life were crossing with each other and separating. At the end, they were in one shot.</p>
		<p>The scene of the movie was simple. It was only our campus and the beach near our school.  And we only took about one week to make those clips. All chips were taken by cameras or phones. It was five years ago. And the technologies of devices were not fancy as now. Because the technic of filming was normal and easy at that time, planning a stage and making people beautiful on screen is not easy to do.  I learnt using bright or dark light to create atmosphere. One of member in our team is an experienced cameraman. She was the major filming person, and I did help her and learn many things from her. However, the movie was not wonderful as our thought. One reason should be related to shooting. We changed several devices during the movie, and the picture was changed unpredictable during the movie.</p>
		<p>After the process of shooting, we started to editing and other back stage work. It is the work I volunteer to do because I did cut some short clips for other presentation previously. Therefore, I think it would not be hard to edit a movie. However, it is not easy as I thought. I used two editing software, iMovie and Premier to do editing. For a movie, I need to look up for every frame. And I need to listen to every sentence to avoid cutting it lost. And for some part the record is hard to hear or having some noise at the background. I need add some music in. Although I studied piano for five years, the selecting music was still my weakness to do. I talked with my group mates about the atmosphere of each scene could be and asked them for appropriate music. Major music I added in is from famous movie. I also add frame changing between different scenes. Also, I did the bi-lingual subtitle for the movie. My favorite part about the editing is for the beginning and end. I use the taking-off and landing of an airplane cross with the day and night scene of the school. At the beginning, I use this idea just for fun. I told my group about this thought, they said it would be interesting surprised me. And I tried to do it and result is delightful. By editing the movie, I learnt more about the technology of the software.</p>
		<p>After we finish this movie, I record some DVDs to some my teachers as a gift. And I got some good feedback from them. The process of acting, filming and editing is not easy to do. Using of the camera and editing software needs time to study as well. I hoped to do study this area more deeply.  So, I talked with my parents to study the media major in the future. After a long time discuss, my parents finally accepted that. </p>
		<p>When I started my major study in Michigan State, I felt it is little different than I thought. It had various subject not related to my major but required by university.  And for beginning, there are much basic knowledge courses as entry level. </p>
